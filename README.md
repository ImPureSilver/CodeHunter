# Borderlands: CodeHunter
A SHiFT Code hunting program for the Borderlands franchise.

# How does it work?
Simply put, add in the websites you wish to have codes scapped from
and have it be saved in a local folder on your PC.

# Installation
Well, there is no installation, but I have the code put up here to have it be cloned and
have it build on IntelliJ IDEA or any other way of getting the code to run Main.java.

There should not be any dependecy issues due to this being made in pure Java 8.

# Goals
My Goals for this project is for it to become a lesser hassle to
get any SHiFT code for the Borderlands games.

So, the initial idea was to have a program that runs in the background
of my PC/Raspberry Pi and just visit it to only drop in new sites.
Have those sites checked for codes and have those added
to my account.

# What's the purpose going forward?
That'll have to depend on how well me or others that are interested goes.
In the future, I wish to make the program redeem codes automatically and
have it run in the background securely. For now, I am not very familiar with
security or how I can make CodeHunter run in the background.
