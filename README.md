# Borderlands: CodeHunter
A SHiFT Code hunting program for the Borderlands franchise.

# How does it work?
Simply put, add in the websites you wish to have codes scapped from
and have it be saved in a local folder on your PC.

# Installation
Well, there is no installation, but I have the code put up here to have it be cloned and
have it build on IntelliJ IDEA or any other way of getting the code to run Main.java.

There should not be any dependecy issues due to this being made in pure Java 8.

# Goals
    - Automate the code redemption process
    - Create an installer to make runnin the program easire
    - Come up with an efficent way to run this in the background
    - Create a easy to use GUI
    - Create an Account Management option
    - Create an Advanced menu for things like: Creating your own RegEx

# What's the purpose going forward?
That'll have to depend on how well me or others that are interested goes.
For now, I am not very familiar with security or how I can make 
CodeHunter run in the background.
